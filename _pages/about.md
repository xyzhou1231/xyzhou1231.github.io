 **Formation Collaboration Intelligent Tactical Decision Model and Interoperability Design**
  <br>
  (Project led by Chengdu Aircraft Design Institute )
<br>
- The project developed a drone formation collaborative air combat decision-making system, simulating air combat scenarios of drone formations. The system mainly includes: situation assessment system, tactical control system, and tactical decision-making system. The main algorithms used are neural network algorithms, reinforcement learning algorithms, Bayesian networks, etc.
<br>
- During my second year of master's studies, I led team members to complete this project. In the course of the project, I learned to proficiently use the Python programming language and gained an understanding of cutting-edge artificial intelligence algorithms such as neural networks and reinforcement learning.

  **Integrated Communication Identification Simulation System**
  <br>
  (Project led by Shenyang Aircraft Design Institute )
<br>
- A human-computer interaction interface for the 1553B (Aviation Onboard Bus Comprehensive System) was designed based on the QT platform, featuring encoding and decoding functionalities as per the 1553B bus protocol. The project utilized C++ language on the QT platform for the design of the human-computer interaction interface, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of data during transmission, reception, storage, and playback.
<br>
- As the student leader of the project, I oversaw and participated in the entire process. Throughout the project, I mastered the C++ programming language and became proficient in using the QT platform.

 **Formation Collaboration Intelligent Tactical Decision Model and Interoperability Design**
  <br>
  (Project led by Chengdu Aircraft Design Institute )
<br>
- The project evaluates the autonomous ground attack capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), establishing an assessment model that includes multi-level evaluation indicators for UAVs. Utilizing the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the project established the weightings for the UAV ground attack capability indicators. Based on MATLAB, a GUI panel for scoring the autonomous ground attack capabilities of UAVs was designed, forming a more scientific and comprehensive assessment system for these capabilities.
<br>
- This project was the first I encountered in the early stages of my postgraduate studies. In the course of this project, I learned to proficiently use the MATLAB programming environment and established a theoretical framework in the field of UAV combat.
