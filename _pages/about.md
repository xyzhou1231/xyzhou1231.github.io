# üë§ Biographies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Shaanxi Province, China in 2001. During the year 2018 to 2022, I was pursuing my Bachelor's Degree at Xi'an Jiaotong University City College. During the years 2022 to 2025, I am pursuing a master's degree in Electronic Science and Technology at Northwestern Polytechnical University. At this time, I am looking for a PhD position that is a suitable fit for me.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My **research interest** includes: Deep Learning, Intelligent Agent Collaborative Control, Reinforcement Learning, signal processing, mathematical modeling etc. 
I have published more than 10 papers in related academic fields.(SCI, EI, CSCD, etc)
