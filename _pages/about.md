# üë§ Biographies
  I was born in Shaanxi Province, China in 2001. During the year 2018 to 2022, I was pursuing my Bachelor's Degree at Xi'an Jiaotong University City College. During the years 2022 to 2025, I am pursuing a master's degree in Electronic Science and Technology at Northwestern Polytechnical University. At this time, I am looking for a PhD position that is a suitable fit for me.
<br>
  My research interest includes Signal Processing, Machine Learning and Mathematical Modelling, etc. 
I have published more than 10 papers in related academic fields.

- A UAV trajectory prediction model based on flight state recognition is proposed in the paper.
First, UAV flight information acquisition and data preprocessing are carried out;
Second, a UAV flight state recognition model is established based on the PCA-SVM model;
Finally, a UAV trajectory prediction model based on five flight state recognition is established.
- The UAV trajectory prediction model based on flight state recognition proposed in this paper will play a crucial role in the field of intelligent autonomous UAV flight in the future, which provides assistance for autonomous flying UAVs in recognizing their own flight states and predicting their trajectories.

- A wireless motion sensor node monitoring system was designed to address the problem that the human body has variable parameters during exercise and real-time online monitoring is not easy to realise.
- The hardware structure of the monitoring system was designed based on STM32 to achieve the acquisition of human ECG, temperature and posture signals. The solution model of human body sign parameters was designed to achieve the monitoring and management of the sign parameters such as heart rate, body temperature and exercise steps.
