[UAV Trajectory Prediction Based on Flight State Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214303)

Jiandong Zhang, **Zhuoyong Shi**, Anli Zhang, etc

[**Project**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214303) :The Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi (No. 2022JQ-593) ;Key R&D Program of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Science and Technology(No. 2022GY-089)

- UAV trajectory prediction is the core technology for autonomous UAV flight and is a prerequisite for control and navigation.
- In this paper, the UAV flight path prediction model is established by collecting the flight data of the actual UAV.

- A wireless motion sensor node monitoring system was designed to address the problem that the human body has variable parameters during exercise and real-time online monitoring is not easy to realise.
- The hardware structure of the monitoring system was designed based on STM32 to achieve the acquisition of human ECG, temperature and posture signals. The solution model of human body sign parameters was designed to achieve the monitoring and management of the sign parameters such as heart rate, body temperature and exercise steps.
